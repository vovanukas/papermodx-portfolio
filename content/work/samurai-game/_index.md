In this project, I was in charge of designing and implementing the audio features of the game. These features included:

- A menu system
- Dynamic water audio system (with depth detection)

- Footsteps audio
- Dialogue
- Music implementation
- Quest music variation

The project was built using Unity and FMOD.
