## Room Treatment

Suggested the strategic placement of six foam pads behind the sitting position on each side to eliminate flutter echo and enhance recording quality.

Recommended hexagonal tiles to serve both as sound absorbers and decorative elements, with a specific formation for optimized sound absorption.

Advocated for the addition of a carpet beneath the speaking position to reduce floor-to-ceiling reflections and flutter echo.

Addressed aesthetics, including wall color coordination with sound absorbers, LED strips for accentuating room details and providing color options, and adaptability of wall signs for personalization.
