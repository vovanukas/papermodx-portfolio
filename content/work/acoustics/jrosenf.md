## Analysis Process

Initiated the analysis by recording precise room measurements, including length, width, height, and volume.

Evaluated room ratios and Bonello Criteria to assess bass resonance and room mode suitability.

Discussed the concept of room modes and their impact on sound perception.


## Identifying Acoustic Challenges

Highlighted the room's unsuitable RT60 (reverberation time) for a home cinema, emphasizing the need for improvement.

Recommended GIK Acoustics Tri Trap Bass Traps to regulate low frequencies, reduce muddiness, and achieve the desired RT60 and presented the absorption chart for Tri Trap Bass Traps, showcasing their effectiveness.

Introduced diffusers on the back wall to enhance sound diffusion and prevent flutter echo.

## Room Treatment

Demonstrated the transformation of RT60 with the application of acoustic treatment, resulting in an even and optimal reverberation time for a home cinema.

Addressed speaker placement, emphasizing the importance of a 7.2.4 system and providing guidance on speaker positioning.

Discussed the significance of wall soundproofing to ensure quietness outside the room, suggesting an STC-rated wall and additional soundproofing measures.

Explored door soundproofing solutions, including door types, gap sealing, and acoustic blankets.

Presented methods for ceiling soundproofing, including insulation, resilient channels, mass addition, and drywall layers.

## Overall Outcome

The analysis aimed to optimize the room's acoustics, particularly focusing on RT60 improvement and soundproofing to create an ideal home cinema experience.

The proposed solutions were designed to enhance sound quality, eliminate unwanted noise, and improve overall acoustic performance.
