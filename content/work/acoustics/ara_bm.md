The client has provided me with precise room measurements and based on them I have ran a series of room ration analysis ([University of Salford Room Sizing Graph](https://hub.salford.ac.uk/sirc-acoustics/architecture-and-building-acoustics/room-sizing-for-studios/), Bonello Criteria and Bolt Area Analysis).

Based on the results, we have went for strategic bass trap placement in the corners of the room, targeting high low-frequency pressure zones with bass buildup.

Tackled first reflections and flutter echo with precise broadband absorber placement, calculated through a ray-tracing simulation.
