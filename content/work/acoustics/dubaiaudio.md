In this project I was tasked to integrate 4 audio systems into a single home-theatre room. With consistent back and fourth communication I was able to come up with a great solution for my client.

Since the client has supplied an acoustically transparent screen, I was able to place all of the centre speakers behind the screen. This resulted in all speakers being placed up to Dolby specifications.

For low-profile acoustic treatment I have used [WoodUpp Akupanel Acoustic Panels](https://woodupp.com/). The end result looks stunning and most importantly - sounds great!
