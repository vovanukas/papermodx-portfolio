Client had a very awkward space high ceiling space and a loft. Through communication with the client, we have decided to convert the high ceiling space into a live space and the loft into a nice custom-designed storage area and an iso-booth.

There were numerous challenges in this project from room dimensions not aligning with recommended criteria to the slanted ceiling.
