This client had an office space, which he wanted to convert into a professional recording studio. The space was completely empty, so it was a design, which I had to come up with from the grounds up. Since the studio had unfortunate room ratios and thus we had to add an extra wall to make the room smaller. We have used the space behind that wall perfectly for storage.

Based on the results, we have went for strategic bass trap placement in the corners of the room, targeting high low-frequency pressure zones with bass buildup.

Tackled first reflections and flutter echo with precise broadband absorber placement, calculated through a ray-tracing simulation.
