The project was to optimize the sound quality in a studio room by achieving an RT60 between 0.3s and 0.5s, through adjustments to room layout, speaker placement, and sound treatment.

This included moving furniture to create a cozier atmosphere, positioning the speakers in the center of the room, and using bass traps and sound absorbers to reduce room modes and flutter echo.

The goal was to achieve an even frequency response across the spectrum, with no frequency remaining prevalent in the room.
