From the start room measurements were taken using REW and a measurement microphone, which has shown phase issues due to the non-central speaker position.

Optimization of this living room studio was achieved by moving furniture to create a sensible acoustic set-up, positioning the speakers in the center of the room, and using bass traps and sound absorbers to reduce room modes and flutter echo.

The goal of this project was achieved: An even frequency response across the spectrum, with no frequency remaining prevalent in the room.
