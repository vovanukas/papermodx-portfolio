For generic pick-up sounds I have used online libraries to find sounds that I enjoy and used Nuendo to cut and polish them, removing any unwanted tails or reverb.

To create more variety for these short sounds, I have separated the sound into tail and body, adding them into 2 random containers and a blend container, which plays the two sound together with a small delay. 

This way, using only 3 sounds I can create 9 different variations.
