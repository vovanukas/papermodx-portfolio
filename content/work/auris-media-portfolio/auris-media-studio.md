### Introduction
Since Auris Media, at the time of my internship, didn't have a recording studio to do foley recordings in, I have suggested that I could create a studio plan for them, as having studied acoustics at Coventry University and running a Fiverr gig creating studios for people, I was confident I could create a good studio for them.

Designing this studio, I aimed to create something modular, which could be easily taken apart and transported in the case of a move.

### Design Process
Using <a href="https://amcoustics.com/tools/amroc" rel="noopener" target="_blank" >amroc room mode calculator</a>, I have calculated the ideal size for the studio, which would be 339x281x233cm (LxWxH), this would create a good distribution of room modes within the room, requiring less low-frequency treatment.

To make sure that the studio was soundproof, I used <a href="https://amcoustics.com/tools/amroc" rel="noopener" target="_blank" >this STC calculator</a>, to understand what materials I should use for the walls and how thick I should make them.

In the end I have decided to use a staggered stud construction with 24‚Äù stud spacing, 2 drywalls on one side and 1 on the other on resilient channels and add mineral wool insulation. This would bring our STC to ~60, which means that loud music would be faintly audible.

For the floor, I have decided to add a counter floor with heavy office-grade carpet on top. The counter floor is to be implemented with Auralex U-Boat floaters.

Using an RT60 calculator, I treated the room using Akotherm Baffle, absorbers Auris Media had purchased, to reach an RT60 of 0.3-0.4s, which is recommended for recording studios.

### Result

In the end, I created a studio that Auris Media were happy with and they have sent it off to acoustic professionals for evaluation and a quote. At the time of writing, they have not come back so while I believe my calculations are correct, I don't have a professional review.
