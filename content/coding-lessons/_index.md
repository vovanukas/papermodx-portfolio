On the 16th of February codetoday will stop live courses and we won't be able to have lessons through them. If you are on this page, this means you are still interested in having lessons together, thankfully, so am I! I am working on rolling out a nice website for my tutoring side, but for now this is the landing page.

If you are interested in continuing your childs education with me - let's talk!

You can contact me on this email: <a href="mailto:malvladimiras@gmail.com">malvladimiras@gmail.com</a>,

use the <a href="/contact/">contact form</a> or any other method on my <a href="/">home page!</a>

Look forward to hearing from you!
