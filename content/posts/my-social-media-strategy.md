## Social media strategy framework
For my social media strategy framework, I have chosen a structure outlined by the University of Groningen(n.d.)<cite>[^1]</cite>. It provides a great overview of what goes into the development of a social media plan, each chapter focusing on a different goal.

 
| Chapter   | Goal                      | Talking points                                                                    |
|-----------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Chapter 1 | Introduction              | Why am I writing this social media strategy plan and what do I expect to achieve? |
| Chapter 2 | Current Situation         | What is my current social media presence?                                         |
| Chapter 3 | Objectives                | SMART objectives for my social media presence.                                    |
| Chapter 4 | Target Groups & Platforms | Who do I want to reach using which channels?                                      |
| Chapter 5 | Content                   | What content do I want to produce?                                                |
| Chapter 6 | Monitoring                | Would I like to monitor my online presence, and how would I do it?                |
| Chapter 7 | Conclusion                | What are the key takeaways?                                                       |

## Introduction

As a graduate of BSc Music Technology, with a passion for programming and acoustics, I am looking for ways to showcase my expertise, projects and connect with like-minded industry professionals. In this blog post, I will create a social media strategy plan, which will enhance my online presence and hopefully open doors to new opportunities.

## Current Situation

Currently, my professional online presence primarily revolves around my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vladimirasmal/), where I share my acoustic design projects, achievements and connect with industry peers. Additionally, I have three websites which are made for different work areas: [acoustic design](https://www.vovalabs.com), [coding lessons](https://www.codiblox.com), and this personal portfolio.

## Objectives

To make sure my social media efforts are specific and measurable, I will establish SMART objectives for each area:
- **LinkedIn** - Increase my connections to 501 within 3 months, focusing on high quality connections.
- **Acoustic Design** - Create weekly LinkedIn posts showing the acoustic spaces that were designed by me.
- **Programming Tutoring** - Create fortnightly blog posts on the programming website, with Python turtle tutorials.

## Target Groups & Platforms

Although my main goal is to connect with professionals in the acoustics industry, I do want to branch out into other fields that interest me, such as EdTech and the games industry. LinkedIn will remain my main platform for engaging with people professionally. For my programming and acoustics businesses, I will try to build blogs tackling frequent problems in acoustics or tutorials in programming, this will improve my search engine rankings and bring potential customers to my website.

## Content

Recently, I have been experimenting with long form content by creating a blog post on LinkedIn talking about my experience during the Auditorium Acoustics 2023 conference. This article got 16 view but the readers were very kind and have left praise in the comments. I hope by expanding my network, I would be able to increase article views and spread awareness about such conferences.

Overall, I do try to make weekly content on LinkedIn but, as was established earlier, would love to add more long form content to my website.

## Monitoring

With my currently small online presence, I do not feel the need to monitor it. But to keep myself informed about mentions of me online, I will create a Google email alert of any mentions of my name and lastname.

## Conclussion

This social media plan should provide me with a good foundation to broaden my online presence and try to open new doors of interesting opportunities. A quick to-do list would include:

- Create a Google alert for mentions of me online.
- Weekly posts on LinkedIn sharing my life.
- Fortnightly long tutorial posts on the Codiblox website.
- Fortnightly blog posts on the acoustics website.
