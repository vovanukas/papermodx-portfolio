### Introduction
During the years 2022-2023, as part of my BSc Music Technology course, I have decided to partake in a sandwich year placement opportunity in Game Audio. I was hoping to jump ahead of my studies and learn more about sound in video games, how to work with it, and most importantly – enhance my postgraduate employability.

Finding a placement was not an easy feat, I have spent a long while tailoring my CV, crafting my cover letters, and reaching out to professionals. After receiving tons of emails declining the internship opportunity, I talked about it with one of my professors, Susanne Grunewald. She recommended me a list of video game studios in the Netherlands and shared some personal connections.

Reaching out to these personal connections proved to be a success, as Auris Media replied to my cold email. The next step was a constant back and forth chain of communication to figure out the days I would be able to work at their office and signage of documents. After a Learning Agreement, Risk Assessment, and an NDA were crafted and signed, I was able to proceed to join them in the office.

The whole process took about 5 months, from our first interview to the final email.

### The Netherlands
I was not alone in moving to the Netherlands, as my girlfriend, Adelina, has started university in Den Haag, so it was a very lucky situation that I was able to find a placement here. We have decided to leave Lithuania by bus 2 weeks before the start of our academic year, on the 27th of August. Since plane tickets were super expensive, we decided to settle on a 25-hour bus drive.

The 2 weeks were full of exploring Den Haag, meeting Adelinas course mates, and going to induction events, which were hosted by her university. This helped a lot to establish some roots within the country and most importantly to find acquaintances.

The Netherlands certainly left a big first impression. We were amazed by the big city centre, the number of people and students who live in it and the cultural mix that they bring to the city. But my favourite part about it all was the beach since we still were able to catch a few days of warmth and spend them relaxing by the beach.

Everything was brand new and exciting, eventually after settling in it was time to meet everyone at Auris Media.

### Auris Media
We have decided that I would come in for the first time on September 6th. The commute from Den Haag to Soest takes about 2 hours, but it was my first time travelling by train in the Netherlands, so the time flew right past me.

At the office, I was warmly greeted by Michel, Wouter, and Martijn. They had prepared a desk for me, and the process of onboarding has started. I had to come up with a learning roadmap, learning goals and download Wwisse along with Unreal Engine 5, which would be my main tools during this internship.

The first few weeks included a lot of learning how to navigate and use Cubase, Wwise, and Unreal Engine 5. I was also introduced to the game that Auris Media were working on, which was an interesting multiplayer exploration and survival PvP game. I was impressed by the creativity and attention to detail that the team put into the soundscape that they have created for the game at the time. After I was able to learn the tools and the workflow, I became a part of the team adding my own elements into the game.

No day is the same at Auris Media, as it is a small company of 3 people, so everyone wears multiple hats and has an even say in the company. I was able to swing like a pendulum from working on sound implementation for video games to planning a future studio for Auris Media. What is consistent is our “toastie breaks”, where we all gather around the table, eating a toastie, chatting about what is new in our lives, what we are working on, and any other exciting stuff. 

These breaks were more than just a chance to relax and catch up on each other's lives; they were also a time for brainstorming and problem-solving. We would use these breaks to bounce ideas off each other and come up with creative solutions for challenges that the company faced. I felt like a valued member of the team and appreciated the open and collaborative culture at Auris Media.

The role is everything I expected and more, thanks to the company being a small start-up I was able to quickly grow from just learning the software suite to being fully immersed in their workflow, delivering audio systems for the game that Auris Media are working on.

### Free time
Of course, I didn’t come here just to work. During my time in the Netherlands, I was able to explore cities like Rotterdam, Utrecht, Amsterdam, Delft and even visit Paris, which is just an 8-hour bus ride from The Hague (the night bus makes it bearable). The last thing I was in the Netherlands is bored; hanging out by the sea during the last warm summer days, going out to eat in restaurants representing various nationalities, accidentally stumbling into a karaoke night at a student bar after a failed attempt at clubbing, going to Panorama Mesdag gallery and seeing a surreal panorama painting of the Scheveningen beach.

All of this made the internship experience even more enjoyable than it is. Yet there are still many things that I plan to visit, Brussels being one of them.

But living in the Netherlands and enjoying these experiences isn’t free. Since I did have some personal savings and the funds provided by the Turing scheme, I have decided to stray away from retail, hospitality, and the “usual student work” and instead use my university experience, especially the acoustics module, to find work online. I have created a Fiverr account, through which I was able to start selling gigs and providing acoustic design services.

As of writing this blog, I have been working on Fiverr for about 4 months and I was able to complete 17 jobs and make about £700. I realised, I was good at it but required a bigger audience, that is when I created a landing page and started advertising it on various internet platforms.

Thankfully, with my experience working as a teacher in the UK. I was able to get a few jobs tutoring children in programming languages such as Python, Scratch, and Lua. This allowed me to work part-time and arrange classes freely around my travels, internship, and my acoustic consulting business. 

I am happy I was able to secure a placement abroad, as it allowed me to explore another exciting culture and visit interesting new places. I would certainly recommend to others to take a placement opportunity abroad, given the chance. It is important to make the most of your free time to immerse yourself in the culture, meet new people and broaden your horizons. However, to do that it is important to maintain a healthy work-life balance by clearly outlining and organising your work commitments and responsibilities.

### Conclusion
One of the biggest challenges I faced during my internship at Auris Media, was the need to balance the technical knowledge of programming with creativity. As a Music Technology student, I was well taught about the technical aspects of audio production, but working in the game industry required me to think outside the box and come up with solutions to balance performance and user experience. It was a steep learning curve, but one that I embraced wholeheartedly and that taught me a lot about the importance of flexibility and adaptability in the workplace.

The successes far outweigh the challenges. During this internship, I was able to get valuable insights into how to run a business, learned how to program in Unreal Engine 5, and use industry standard software for audio implementation into video games. Because I have moved out of my comfort zone and decided to travel to the Netherlands, I have decided that I don’t want to be bound to a physical job. This led me to improve my online portfolio and to start offering acoustic design services on Fiverr.

Overall, I have learnt a lot from my placement year and most importantly it gave me a portfolio and something to put on my CV for future employers to see. Now, I have experience in Wwise and UE5 and that makes me more employable in a post-graduate setting. Furthermore, the ability to work with a game engine will help me in my Game Audio module at Coventry University.
