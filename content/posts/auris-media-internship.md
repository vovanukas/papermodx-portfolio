### Introduction
During the years of 2022-2023, as part of my BSc Music Technology course, I have decided to partake in a sandwich year placement opportunity in Game Audio. I was hoping to jump ahead of my studies and learn more about sound in video games, how to work with and most importantly – enhance my postgraduate employability. 

Finding a placement was not an easy feat, I have spent a long while tailoring my CV, crafting my cover letters, reaching out to professionals. After receiving tons of emails declining the internship opportunity, I have talked about it with one of my professors, Susanne Grunewald. She recommended me a list of video game studios in the Netherlands and shared some personal connections.

Reaching out to these personal connections proved to be a success, as Auris Media replied to my cold email. Next step was a constant back and forth chain of communication to figure out the days I would be able to work at their office and signage of documents. After a Learning Agreement, Risk Assessment was crafted and signed, I was able to proceed to join them in the office.

The whole process took about 5 months, from our first interview to the final email.

### The Netherlands
I was not alone moving to the Netherlands, as my girlfriend, Adelina, has started university in Den Haag, so it was a very lucky situation that I was able to find a placement here. We have decided to leave Lithuania by bus 2 weeks before the start of our academic year, on the 27th of August. Since plane tickets were super expensive, we have decided to settle on a 25-hour bus drive.

The 2 weeks were full of exploring Den Haag, meeting Adelinas course mates and going to induction events, which were hosted by her university. Finally, time has come for me to visit Auris Media in their office. 

### Auris Media
We have decided that I would come in for the first time on September 6th. The commute from Den Haag to Soest takes about 2 hours, but it was my first time travelling by train, so the time flew right past me.

At the office I was warmly greeted by Michel, Wouter and Martijn. They had prepared a desk for me, and the process of onboarding has started. I had to come up with a learning roadmap, learning goals and download Wwisse and Unreal Engine 5, which would be my main tools during this internship.

First weeks included a lot of learning how to navigate and use Cubase, Wwise, Unreal Engine 5. But after I was able to learn these tools, I became part of the team.

No day is the same at Auris Media, as it is a small company of 3 people, so everyone wears multiple hats and has even say in the company. I was able to swing like a pendulum from working on sound implementation into video games to marketing to planning a studio for them. What is consistent is our “toastie breaks”, where we all gather around the table, eating a toastie and just chatting about our lives.

I was explained by Michel, that although they are in a company, they act as a “collection of freelancers”. They have the combined company work, but on the side if everything is quiet, they might use company time to work on their personal projects.

The role is everything I expected and more, thanks to the company being a small start-up I was able to quickly grow from just learning the software suite to being a fully immersed in their workflow, delivering audio systems for the game that they are working on.

### Free time
Of course, I didn’t come here just to work. During my time in the Netherlands, I was able to explore cities like Rotterdam, Utrecht, Amsterdam, Delft and even visit Paris, which is just an 8-hour bus ride from The Hague (the night bus makes it bearable). The last thing I was in the Netherlands is bored; hanging out by the sea during the last warm summer days, going out to eat in restaurants representing various nationalities, accidently stumbling into a karaoke night at a student bar after a failed attempt at clubbing, going to Panorama Mesdag gallery and seeing a surreal panorama painting of the Scheveningen beach.

All of this made the internship experience even more enjoyable than it is. Yet there are still many things that I plan to visit, Brussels being one of them.

### Conclusion
The biggest challenge I had to face during my internship year, was actually finding where to internship. After that, I had spent months looking for an apartment. But once I have come to the Hague it was smooth sailing. There are some small hiccups here and there regarding finances, but thankfully I make it work in the end.

The successes far outweigh the challenges. During this internship I was able to get valuable insights into how to run a business, learned how to program in Unreal Engine 5 and use industry standard software for audio implementation into video games. Because I have moved out of my comfort zone and decided to travel to the Netherlands, I have decided that I don’t want to be bound to a physical job. This led me to improve my online portfolio and to start offering acoustic design services on Fiverr.

Overall, I have learnt a lot from my placement year and most importantly it gave me a portfolio and something to put on my CV for future employers to see. Now, I have experience in Wwise and UE5 and that makes me more employable in a post-graduate setting and the ability to work with a game engine will help me in my Game Audio module in Coventry University.
