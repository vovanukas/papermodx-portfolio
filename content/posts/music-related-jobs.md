### Introduction
As part of my professional growth, I undertook 5 combined days of work placement in 3 different areas connected with music and audio.

### Global Game Jam
For 3 days, I was part of a Global Game Jam team on Coventry University campus. I joined a team as a sound designer and within the short amount of time created sound effects and music for a game, which can be seen on my website.

This experience has thought me a valuable lesson in teamwork and collaboration. Furthermore, I learned much about the technical aspect of sound. Working so closely with developers, I was able to watch and learn how my sound design was implemented within the game.

After the Game Jam, I was able to go back to the game and fix some bugs related to audio in it.

### Studio Assistant
For 1 day I helped with recording sessions in a studio. A group of schoolchildren have visited our studio to record some covers for their studies. During this I was helping Susanne with the equipment, miking-up and recording.

During their visit, I have learnt how to encourage singers in a vocal booth to produce better vocals. Susanne has demonstrated how to effectively explain musical terms and plug-ins to children in simple terms.

### Music Teacher
For 1 day I taught music in a school. It was by far the most challenging placement. I had the opportunity of teaching kids music at West Coventry Academy. Being a teacher encompasses many skills. From crowd control to being able to patience, it was a rollercoaster.

This placement has made me realise, that I do not want to continue my career as a teacher and thus I have narrowed down my professional preferences.

### Conclusion
The 5 days combined provided me with amazing experience and helped me decide what I wanted to do professionally.
