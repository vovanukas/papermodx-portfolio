### Introduction
As our last module for our first academic year we have the sound art composition module. As part of it we were tasked with creating a short composition with students from Honk Kong and Madrid. This COIL (Collaborative Online International Learning) project paired me up with two students: Matthew Lam and Manfred Sun.

As soon as I have received the e-mail from Adam with the names and e-mails of my group members I was contacted by Matthew. He invited me into a WhatsApp group and not long after Manfred joined us. We have decided to not dwindle on our project and arrange a meeting as soon as possible. In retrospect, that was a great idea, as we had plenty of time to discuss our wants and needs for the project as well as our skills and equipment.

### First contact & brainstorming
During the meeting we have got to know each other and I was delighted to find out, that all of us had musical education, and I was working alongside people who had the same open-minded mindset as me. After a session of brainstorming it was clear, that we wanted to create a tragic and an intense piece with dark vibes. To make an interesting composition we have decided to follow some kind of a story.

Looking online wasn’t really helpful to us. And I decided to pull things out of my head. Thinking about space and darkness has lead me towards the Soviet space program and what humans (and not only) had to go through to get to that point.

### The Space Race

The Space Race had a huge impact to the development of rockets and the exploration of space. Sadly, with such breakthrough comes the death of many souls. One of the very first living creatures in orbit was a stray dog from the streets of Moscow – Laika. Shortly after launching the first satellite into the orbit, the USSR saw the propaganda potential and hurriedly prepared to launch the first animal to orbit Earth.

Come November 3rd of 1957. They launch the first animal into orbit. Laika was doomed from the start, as scientists were not expecting for her to return alive. Many sources state, that she died shortly after entering orbit, but some state, that she died when returning to Earth.

This story struck me as the perfect inspiration for our musical piece. After presenting my idea, others agreed. We decided upon 3 parts of the composition: first part, “Lift Off”, would be an uplifting melody with primarily orchestral instruments. The second part, “The Orbit”, is based around electronic instruments. It resembles a slow waltz in space. For the third part we have “The Crash”. This is a fast paced part with a tragic ending.

### Composing
Upon agreeing on the idea we split up the work: Manfred was responsible for the percussive part, I was responsible for the electronic part and Matthew was responsible for creating the orchestral arrangement. It is great, that we were able to divide our work into these small parts, as our team had specific skills within the part that we were doing.

After receiving the percussion audio file for the first part I got straight to work thinking of the chords and electronic part of the piece. It was not difficult and I was done within about a day or two and sent it over to Matthew. For the second part I started off by composing the synthesisers, as for the second part we wanted a “spacey” and mysterious feel. I had a blast composing the second part and it came out quite well, so I sent over the files to Matthew in order to add the orchestral part and we had Manfred add percussion at the very end. For the third part I had the same process as with the first part. I had the percussion and composed on top of it, after which I once again sent everything to Matthew. After all of our parts were composed, we sent the stems out to Manfred for mixing and mastering.

### Conclusion
Overall, I had an amazing time working alongside Matthew and Manfred and although there was a difference of 6 hours between us communication was not a problem. I couldn’t have asked for better team members and we haven’t experienced any hiccups what so ever. With the way the composition has come out, it would be a blast to one day hear it be performed live by an orchestra.
